<h1>Command Guide</h1>
<p>G'MIC command documentation follows the classifcation scheme of the <em><a target="_parent" href="http://gmic.eu/gmic_reference.pdf" target="_blank">G'MIC Handbook</a></em> which has pretty much set everyone's expectations of where various commands are. These links will bring you to various tables; the tables will bring you to the commands themselves.</p>
<p>If you are not sure where a command falls in this classification scheme, try <em>'-&lt;command&gt;'</em> in this site's search facility. That is, put the command in single quotes, use the hyphen (which usually means 'not this' in that search box, but the single quotes escape that behavior), and substitute <em>&lt;command&gt;</em> with the command name you think you want.</p>
<p>You may also Google It. the form 'gmic command <em>&lt;command&gt;</em>' will get you content from this site and gmic.eu and, sometimes points in between; these last are (sometimes) gems.</p>

<p>Alas, the command documentation on this site largely reflects the <em>Handbook</em>. As time permits, we'll augment the canonical stubs, furnish extended examples and applications. This will proceed no particular order; those that we use a good deal tend to migrate to the top of the priority stack.</p>
