<h1>Ramps &ndash; a.k.a. &ldquo;Gradients&rdquo;</h1>
<p><img src="http://www.particularart.com/static/media/uploads/BeginnersCookbook/ramps/ramprs.png" title="gmic -function1d 1.0,0,160,127,255,255,232,383,200,511,30 -expand_y[-1] 256 -function1d 0.3,0,250,127,225,255,92,383,160,511,40 -expand_y[-1] 256 -function1d 0.5,0,100,127,230,255,132,383,27,511,120 -expand_y[-1] 256 -a c -polar2euclidean[-1] 0.5,0.5,2.0,2 -d -resize2dx 300,5 -normalize 0,255" class="img_block" style="float: left; margin: 3px; border: 0px solid #808080;" height="301" width="300" />In common with many paint programs, Gimp has a <a target="_parent" href="http://docs.gimp.org/en/gimp-concepts-gradients.html">gradient tool</a>, which makes a field of pixels that change at a constant rate from one color to another. They run along a piece of geometry such as a line segment (linear gradients), but variants along circles (radial) and other flavors are common.</p>
<p>G'MIC employs &ldquo;gradient&rdquo; for a related command which finds tonal variations in an image and generates difference maps. (see <a target="_parent" href="_gradient.shtml">-gradient</a>). This usually sends new folk off to find the &ldquo;real&rdquo; G'MIC gradient command, which, in so many words, they won't find.</p>
<p>That's because there is More Than One Way To Do Gradients in G'MIC and the various methods employ a variety of commands. We'll call these gradient-like things <strong>ramps</strong>, however, to avoid confusion with G'MIC's notion of a gradient, borrowing the term from procedural texturing which use such as pattern parameters.</p>
<p>Some common ramp recipes are on the following pages, these more or less equivalent to Gimp's linear offerings. Visualizations are on the left and the pertinent G'MIC commands (<a target="_parent" href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/snippet">snippets</a>) are on the right. These snippets are meant to be copied and pasted into a UNIX <a target="_parent" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_shell">Bourne or Bash shell</a> or similar, a trick that (probably) won't work with a Windows command shell. For the Redmond bereft, the Gimp-G'MIC plugin furnishes access to the G'MIC command line. Look for the &ldquo;Custom Code&rdquo; filters in the &ldquo;Various&rdquo; set. If you do use the Custom Code filter in Gimp-G'MIC, you don't have to transcribe the '\' character at the end of the lines in our examples; they were put there so that the UNIX shell received what appeared to be one long line.</p>
<p>If you are going to use these examples with a paint program like Gimp or Krita, be sure to finish up with a <a target="_parent" href="_normalize.shtml">-normalize</a> command (-normalize 0,255 for eight bit, -normalize 0,65535 for sixteen bit channels).</p>
